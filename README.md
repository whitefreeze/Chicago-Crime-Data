# Chicago Crime Data
 
This project is about the Chicago Crime Dataset. It has been preprocessed. Exploratory data analysis has been performed looking for trends within individual categories of crime as well as seasonal patterns and crime patterns for each police district. Additional data visualization has also been explored in Tableau (link and screenshot below).
